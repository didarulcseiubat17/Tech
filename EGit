both CVS and SVN are known as centralised version control systems (CVCS). That is, there is one Master repository where people share code; everyone checks out their code (or branch) from that repository, and checks changes back in. For code that needs to be sent person-to-person (for example, for review, or as a way of contributing fixes), it is possible to create a patch, which is a diff of your code against the given Master repository version (often HEAD, but sometimes a branch like Eclipse_35).
