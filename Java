Data Types are int, boolean, and char.
Variables are used to store values.
Whitespace helps make code easy to read for you and others.
Comments describe code and its purpose.
Arithmetic Operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
Relational Operators include <, <=, >, and >=.
Equality Operators include == and !=.

The precedence of each Boolean operator is as follows:
! is evaluated first
&& is evaluated second
|| is evaluated third

ternary conditional(shortcut of if-else): ----? -:-

Boolean Operators: &&, ||, and ! are used to build Boolean expressions and have a defined order of operations
Statements: if, if/else, and if/else if/else statements are used to conditionally execute blocks of code
Ternary Conditional: a shortened version of an if/else statement that returns a value based on the value of a Boolean expression
Switch: allows us to check equality of a variable or expression with a value that does not need to be a Boolean

Class: a blueprint for how a data structure should function
Constructor: instructs the class to set up the initial state of an object
Object: instance of a class that stores the state of a class
Method: set of instructions that can be called on an object
Parameter: values that can be specified when creating an object or calling a method
Return value: specifies the data type that a method will return after it runs
Inheritance: allows one class to use functionality defined in another class

For Loops: used to repeatedly run a block of code
For Each Loops: a concise version of a for loop
ArrayList: stores a list of data
HashMap: stores keys and associated values like a dictionary

Variables:///////
In Java, all objects are dynamically allocated on Heap. To allocate memory to an object, we must use new(). 

final variables in Java////////
In Java, when final keyword is used with a variable of primitive data types (int, float, .. etc), value of the variable cannot be changed.
When final is used with non-primitive variables (Note that non-primitive variables are always references to objects in Java), the members of the referred object can be changed. final for non-primitive variables just mean that they cannot be changed to refer to any other object

Unlike C++, we donâ€™t need forward declarations in Java. Identifiers (class and method names) are recognized automatically from source files. Similarly, library methods are directly read from the libraries, and there is no need to create header files with declarations.

String////////////////
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
class Test
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        String s= "GeeksforGeeks";
        // or String s= new String ("GeeksforGeeks");
 
        // Returns the number of characters in the String.
        System.out.println("String length = " + s.length());
 
        // Returns the character at ith index.
        System.out.println("Character at 3rd position = "
                           + s.charAt(3));
 
        // Return the substring from the ith  index character
        // to end of string
        System.out.println("Substring " + s.substring(3));
 
        // Returns the substring from i to j-1 index.
        System.out.println("Substring  = " + s.substring(2,5));
 
        // Concatenates string2 to the end of string1.
        String s1 = "Geeks";
        String s2 = "forGeeks";
        System.out.println("Concatenated string  = " +
                            s1.concat(s2));
 
        // Returns the index within the string
        // of the first occurrence of the specified string.
        String s4 = "Learn Share Learn";
        System.out.println("Index of Share " + 
                           s4.indexOf("Share"));
 
        // Returns the index within the string of the
        // first occurrence of the specified string,
        // starting at the specified index.
        System.out.println("Index of a  = " + 
                           s4.indexOf('a',3));
 
        // Checking equality of Strings
        Boolean out = "Geeks".equals("geeks");
        System.out.println("Checking Equality  " + out);
        out = "Geeks".equals("Geeks");
        System.out.println("Checking Equality  " + out);
 
        out = "Geeks".equalsIgnoreCase("gEeks ");
        System.out.println("Checking Equality" + out);
 
        int out1 = s1.compareTo(s2);
        System.out.println("If s1 = s2" + out);
 
        // Converting cases
        String word1 = "GeeKyMe";
        System.out.println("Changing to lower Case " +
                            word1.toLowerCase());
 
        // Converting cases
        String word2 = "GeekyME";
        System.out.println("Changing to UPPER Case " + 
                            word1.toUpperCase());
 
        // Trimming the word
        String word4 = " Learn Share Learn ";
        System.out.println("Trim the word " + word4.trim());
 
        // Replacing characters
        String str1 = "feeksforfeeks";
        System.out.println("Original String " + str1);
        String str2 = "feeksforfeeks".replace('f' ,'g') ;
        System.out.println("Replaced f with g -> " + str2);
    } 
}

Scanner://////
import java.util.Scanner;
// Declare the object and initialize with
        // predefined standard input object
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
 
        // String input
        String name = sc.nextLine();
 
        // Character input
        char gender = sc.next().charAt(0);
 
        // Numerical data input
        // byte, short and float can be read
        // using similar-named functions.
        int age = sc.nextInt();
        long mobileNo = sc.nextLong();
        double cgpa = sc.nextDouble();

Addition and Concatenation: compiler evaluates the given expression from left to right given that the operators have same precedence. Once it encounters the String, it considers the rest of the expression as of a String (again based on the precedence order of the expression).
