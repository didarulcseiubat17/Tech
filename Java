Data Types are int, boolean, and char.
Variables are used to store values.
Whitespace helps make code easy to read for you and others.
Comments describe code and its purpose.
Arithmetic Operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
Relational Operators include <, <=, >, and >=.
Equality Operators include == and !=.

The precedence of each Boolean operator is as follows:
! is evaluated first
&& is evaluated second
|| is evaluated third

ternary conditional(shortcut of if-else): ----? -:-

Boolean Operators: &&, ||, and ! are used to build Boolean expressions and have a defined order of operations
Statements: if, if/else, and if/else if/else statements are used to conditionally execute blocks of code
Ternary Conditional: a shortened version of an if/else statement that returns a value based on the value of a Boolean expression
Switch: allows us to check equality of a variable or expression with a value that does not need to be a Boolean

Class: a blueprint for how a data structure should function
Constructor: instructs the class to set up the initial state of an object
Object: instance of a class that stores the state of a class
Method: set of instructions that can be called on an object
Parameter: values that can be specified when creating an object or calling a method
Return value: specifies the data type that a method will return after it runs
Inheritance: allows one class to use functionality defined in another class

For Loops: used to repeatedly run a block of code
For Each Loops: a concise version of a for loop
ArrayList: stores a list of data
HashMap: stores keys and associated values like a dictionary
