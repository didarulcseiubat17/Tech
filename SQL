RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables.
A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

Tables contain records (rows) with data.
SQL is NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. The result is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;
The DISTINCT keyword can be used to return only distinct (different) values.
The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified criterion.
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes). However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes
The AND operator displays a record if both the first condition AND the second condition are true.
The OR operator displays a record if either the first condition OR the second condition is true.

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
AND City='Berlin';

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in a descending order, you can use the DESC keyword.
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table
The UPDATE statement is used to update records in a table.
The DELETE statement is used to delete rows in a table.

SQL Injection Based on ""="" is Always True  -----SQL injection is a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into an SQL statement, via web page input.

txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @0";
db.Execute(txtSQL,txtUserId);

Note that parameters are represented in the SQL statement by a @ marker.
The SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally, and not as part of the SQL to be executed.
